# Galois - Crypto for Anonymization
This repository implements some Order-Preserving (OPE), Prefix-Preserving (PPE )and Format-Preserving Encryption (FPE) algorithms. This tool is meant to perform encryption and decryption over large data sets, preserving the properties of the chosen columns. Well-known symmetric encryption algorithms, like AES and Blowfish are also supported.
